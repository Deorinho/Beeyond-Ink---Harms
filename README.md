# Beeyond-Ink---Harms

  This is my first render of the landing page I would like to create for my very talented tattoo artist.
I wanted to encompass art and fluidity using parallax effects in natural css.
it is the first time I have experimented with the parallax concept.

  Primarily I split both divs into wrappers ( one which is what the user sees before the parallax, and another after the parallax)
this then acts like mirror images however the speeds of the different wrappers are different allowing the 'foreground to move faster than
the background'.

This is an ongoing project that will be featured on my portfolio which has a TBA date.

As of now the first render consists of a landing page where there are three headings:
1. Inked by harms ~ a link to her instagram
2. Her job title ~ a link to the business website
3. contact me ~ a pop up of phone number and directions to the store
I plan on tranforming the words into possible text boxes or just hyperlink them to their respective locations 



THINGS FOR RENDER 2:
Alongside I want to have multiple pieces of her work to appear and disappear upon vertical scrolling with a tiny blurb and a learn more button
as well as a link to the instagram post as well.

on the contact me page i want to either make a pop up window or on the website itself. however it will include directions, hours, contact info of artist as well as additional info on Covid or whatever...

I would like to change the layout to match the bee motif as well as the black and yellow palette used in their business logo.
