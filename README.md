# Beeyond-Ink---Harms

  This is my first render of the landing page I would like to create for my very talented tattoo artist.
I wanted to encompass art and fluidity using parallax effects in natural css.
it is the first time I have experimented with the parallax concept.

  Primarily I split both divs into wrappers ( one which is what the user sees before the parallax, and another after the parallax)
this then acts like mirror images however the speeds of the different wrappers are different allowing the 'foreground to move faster than
the background'.

This is an ongoing project that will be featured on my portfolio which has a TBA date.
